# NFT_Card
A NFT card created as a task from Frontendmentor.is


It was a pleasent surprise learning that you can make colors in a root, so you dont have to always enter the whole hex, rgb or color name, or everithing.
Just enter color: var(--what color you need--);
example is in the css file.
Playing around in inspect element in Google Chrome thing are a litte faster when you try out firsthand on an actual web browser. 
Not enter code, save, review, and backa again.
